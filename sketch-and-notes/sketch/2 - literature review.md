# Literature review
## Review plan
**NOTE:** there was an initial informal study that helped inform the direction of research and formulate research questions

### Methodology
based on:
- [[Guidance on Conducting a Systematic Literature Review]]
- [[Systematic Literature Review in Computer Science - A Practical Guide]]
- [Guidelines for Performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258968007_Kitchenham_B_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_software_engineering_EBSE_Technical_Report_EBSE-2007-01)

### Research questions
#### RQ 1: _What approaches are used for modelling graphical user interfaces?_
- the premise of the work is to transform graphical data into an abstract representation; its choice is an extremely important one as it might impact the whole solution

#### RQ 2: _How can a graphical representation of GUI be converted to a machine-readable one?_
- see how others do it, what initial and final representations do they use, what are the results, strengths, and limitations

### Keywords
keywords from the questions, with synonyms or related terms

#### RQ 1
- graphical user interface
	- GUI
	- UI
	- user interface
	- graphical interface
- modelling
	- (abstract/platform-independent) (meta-)model
	- (abstract/platform-independent) representation
	- modelling language
	- specification

#### RQ 2
- graphical user interface
	- GUI
	- UI
	- user interface
	- graphical interface
- convert
	- transform(ation)
	- rewrite/rewriting
	- recreate/recreating
	- generate/generation
- machine(-readable)
	- code
	- implementation

### Justification
- identify the state of the art
- point out gaps and further the body of knowledge
- build upon relevant and useful knowledge
- inform the architecture/techniques/solutions used in the method

#### RQ 1
- based on the keywords above, no on-topic systematic review has been found (on 4.02.2022)
- J. Vanderdonckt performed several semi-formal reviews of user interface description languages over the years; the authors describe the criteria of evaluation/description of languages but document it rather scantly; they claim to attempt to describe a UI for a simple application, however no code or UI examples are provided; moreover, the last review seems to have been published in 2010, that is more than 10 years from now; this justifies another review
    - [A Review of XML-compliant User Interface Description Languages](A%20Review%20of%20XML-compliant%20User%20Interface%20Description%20Languages.md) (2003)
    - [A Theoretical Survey of User Interface Description Languages - Preliminary Results](A%20Theoretical%20Survey%20of%20User%20Interface%20Description%20Languages%20-%20Preliminary%20Results.md) (2009)
    - [A Theoretical Survey of User Interface Description Languages - Complementary Results](A%20Theoretical%20Survey%20of%20User%20Interface%20Description%20Languages%20-%20Complementary%20Results.md) (2010)
- the articles provide references that might serve as a benchmark for the effectiveness of the review
- [based on the review](Which%20papers%20from%20UIDL%20reviews%20do%20I%20include%20in%20the%20literature%20review.md), 13 papers about UIDLs described are going to be included in the review; papers not found through the primary search are going to be added *before* the first screening of inclusion
- additional keyword/term identified: "user interface description language/UIDL‚Äù

#### RQ 2
- TODO: look for an SLR

### Protocol (further steps)
- read the reports; document the conclusions; perform first screening for inclusion on references (titles and/or abstracts)
- specify databases
- specify final list of keywords
- additional search criteria, to be used where possible:
	- papers from around the last 20 years (informed by the pre-review research, possibly rich history of solutions)
	- papers only related to computer science/software engineering/etc.
	- papers primarily in English; German or Polish acceptable if need be
- perform searches (adjust the search strings for each database)
- document search results (search base, search date, number of items, exact search string)
- refine search strings, if the need arises
- first screening for inclusion; based on titles and abstracts
	- document noteworthy 
- second screening for inclusion; based on introductions and conclusions
	- possible exclusion criteria:
		- not enough relevancy
	- document any other criteria/reasons for exclusion
- third screening for inclusion based on full text
- data extraction and analysis (TODO: specify more thoroughly later?)
