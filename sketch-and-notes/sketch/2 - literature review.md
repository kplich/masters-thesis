# Literature review
## Review plan
**NOTE:** there was an initial informal study that helped inform the direction of research and formulate research questions

### Methodology
based on:
- [Guidance on Conducting a Systematic Literature Review](https://doi.org/10.1177/0739456X17723971)
- [Systematic Literature Review in Computer Science - A Practical Guide](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.35453.87524)
- [Guidelines for Performing Systematic Literature Reviews in Software Engineering](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258968007_Kitchenham_B_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_software_engineering_EBSE_Technical_Report_EBSE-2007-01)

### Research questions
#### RQ 1: _What approaches are used for modelling graphical user interfaces?_
- the premise of the work is to transform graphical data into an abstract representation; its choice is an extremely important one as it might impact the whole solution

#### RQ 2: _How can a graphical representation of GUI be converted to a machine-readable one?_
- see how others do it, what initial and final representations do they use, what are the results, strengths, and limitations

### Keywords
keywords from the questions, with synonyms or related terms

#### RQ 1
- graphical user interface
	- GUI
	- UI
	- user interface
	- graphical interface
- modelling
	- (abstract/platform-independent) (meta-)model
	- (abstract/platform-independent) representation
	- modelling language
	- specification

#### RQ 2
- graphical user interface
	- GUI
	- UI
	- user interface
	- graphical interface
- convert
	- transform(ation)
	- rewrite/rewriting
	- recreate/recreating
	- generate/generation
- machine(-readable)
	- code
	- implementation

### Justification
- identify the state of the art
- point out gaps and further the body of knowledge
- build upon relevant and useful knowledge
- inform the architecture/techniques/solutions used in the method

#### RQ 1
- based on the keywords above, no on-topic systematic review has been found (on 4.02.2022)
- two articles touching on the topic found:
	- [Evaluating user interface generation approaches: model-based versus model-driven  development](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10270-018-0698-x) - an SLR, but not exactly on topic?
	- [Past, Present, and Future of Model-Based User Interface Development](http://dx.doi.org/10.1524/icom.2011.0026) - not an SLR, but more on topic
- the articles provide extra lists of references that might be worth considering during the review
- additional keyword/term identified: "model based user interface development"

#### RQ 2
- TODO: look for an SLR

### Protocol (further steps)
- read the reports; document the conclusions; perform first screening for inclusion on references (titles and/or abstracts)
- specify databases
- specify final list of keywords
- additional search criteria, to be used where possible:
	- papers from around the last 20 years (informed by the pre-review research, possibly rich history of solutions)
	- papers only related to computer science/software engineering/etc.
	- papers primarily in English; German or Polish acceptable if need be
- perform searches (adjust the search strings for each database)
- document search results (search base, search date, number of items, exact search string)
- refine search strings, if the need arises
- first screening for inclusion; based on titles and abstracts
	- document noteworthy 
- second screening for inclusion; based on introductions and conclusions
	- possible exclusion criteria:
		- not enough relevancy
	- document any other criteria/reasons for exclusion
- third screening for inclusion based on full text
- data extraction and analysis (TODO: specify more thoroughly later?)
