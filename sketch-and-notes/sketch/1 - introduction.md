# From UI sketches to a machine-readable representation - introduction
- computing technology is more and more ubiquitous; it's not only for academics or office workers - since the turn of the century, everyday people can also use computers thanks to pretty and easy to use **graphical user interfaces**[^2]
- designing an appealing GUI has never been an easy task for various reasons and it still takes a significant amount of time[^1] and is an important activity while designing software;
- there are many programs that can be used to design user interfaces; nevertheless, despite years of technological advancements both in the industry and in the academia[^3], paper sketches are still one of the most popular[^4] ways of creating UIs, especially during prototyping or in the early stages of development
- paper-based sketches are the preferred method for ideating on designs because of their free-from nature that doesn't constrain creativity, low barrier of entry, and ease of understanding; unfortunately, the analogue medium is not a perfect one: sketches on paper can only stay on paper and are difficult to manage[^5]
- the sketches are useful for discussing UI ideas, but the results always need to be translated into a digital form - either by a designer using a prototyping/design tool or by a developer and his development environment; the process is rather tedious and mechanical [^6] and thus presents itselft as a candidate for (at least partial) automation; time saved on translating a sketch into a prototype could be then utilized more efficiently and fulfillingly
- additionally, manual translation makes the resulting artifact not universal (especially when developing directly in a programming language) - choice of language/framework is usually an irreversible decision; should a developer want to create a prototype in a different language or design software, there's little possibility of translating the artifact between those two and the manual work needs to be done again[^7]
- the goal of thesis is to address these problems and propose a method of translating a paper-based sketch of a user interface to an intermediate representation that can be converted into artifacts more specific to certain technologies and softwares
