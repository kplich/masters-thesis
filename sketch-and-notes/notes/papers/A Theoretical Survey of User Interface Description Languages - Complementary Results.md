# A Theoretical Survey of User Interface Description Languages: Complementary Results
- new work on the [UIDL survey](A%20Theoretical%20Survey%20of%20User%20Interface%20Description%20Languages%20-%20Preliminary%20Results.md)
- limited change or improvements, but “some new approaches that are good to use”

# Introduction
- UsiXML aims to produce a *μ7* UIDL:
    - multi-device
    - multi-platform
    - multi-user
    - multi-linguality/-culturality
    - multi-organisation
    - multi-context
    - multi-modality
- extension of the previous [review](A%20Theoretical%20Survey%20of%20User%20Interface%20Description%20Languages%20-%20Preliminary%20Results.md)

# Recent Advances on User Interface Description Languages
- many languages did not report any notable progress

## [TeresaXML](A%20Theoretical%20Survey%20of%20User%20Interface%20Description%20Languages%20-%20Preliminary%20Results.md#TeresaXML%207)/[MariaXML](A%20Theoretical%20Survey%20of%20User%20Interface%20Description%20Languages%20-%20Preliminary%20Results.md#MariaXML%208)
- relies on the multi-layer levels of the Cameleon Reference Framework
    - data objects
    - interactors
    - events
    - abstract and concrete UI
    - dialogue model
- supported by Mariae (Maria Environment)

## UserML[^1]
- a UIDL to model users
- an OWL ontology
- the main concept is *situational statement*:
    - representation of user model entries
    - context information
    - low-level sensor data

## Mainpart
- an extension of the Resource Definition Framework
- representation of user

*difficult to understand*

## XooML
- support for software for collaboration and document sharing
- **not a genuine UIDL**, just a support for tooling

## [UsiXML](A%20Theoretical%20Survey%20of%20User%20Interface%20Description%20Languages%20-%20Preliminary%20Results.md#User%20Interface%20Extensible%20Markup%20Language%20UsiXML%2010)
*the same text as in previous review, probably*

# Conclusion
just like in the previous review: many languages; choose according to your needs
