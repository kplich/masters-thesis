# [Systematic Literature Review in Computer Science - A Practical Guide](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.35453.87524)

based on [Barbara Kitchenham's report](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258968007_Kitchenham_B_Guidelines_for_performing_Systematic_Literature_Reviews_in_software_engineering_EBSE_Technical_Report_EBSE-2007-01)

## 1. See if there aren't any reviews for the topic

> maybe mention *known papers* from the pre-review phase

## 2. Define the main research questions
What do you want to figure out in your research?

## 3. Define the keywords for searches
- analyze the RQs and extract the keywords
- find synonyms and related terms
- define the [PICOC](https://parsif.al/help/about-the-picoc/) to better delineate the scope/aims of the SR
	- **population** in which the evidence is collected
	- **intervention** applied in the study: which technology, tool or procedure is under study?
	- **comparison** to which the intervention is compared: how is control treatment defined?
	- **outcomes** of the experiment should be statistically and practically significant
	- **context** - extended view of the population: is the experiment conducted in academia or industry; incentives of the subjects, etc.

## 4. Define the search strings
synonyms: `OR`, main terms: `AND`

## 5. Define search engines
- IEEE Xplore (www.ieeexplore.com.br)  
- Scopus (www.scopus.com)  
- ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com)  
- Springer (www.springerlink.com)  
- ACM (www.portal.acm.org)  
- Compendex (www.engineeringvillage.com)

## 6. String refinement
test search strings against known papers and calibrate the search terms

## 7. Search execution
- document what string was used (in what engine)
- how many articles the search returned
- date of execution

## 8. Store search results

## 9. Define inclusion and exclusion criteria
- which papers will go to the next stage?
- **criteria should be derived from the RQs**
- additional criteria:
	- restriction by language
	- r. by area
	- r. by primary articles

## 10. First selection of papers: Analysis by title and abstract

## 11. Second selection of papers: Analysis by introduction and conclusion
- optional, intermediate step

## 12. Third selection of papers: Analysis by full text
- quality criteria/checklist
- exclude less-quality papers

## 13. Extract answers to research questions
