\subsection{Concepts missing}\label{subsec:concepts-missing}

as a reference, web, mobile and desktop technologies are used.

what seems to be missing are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item lotsa widgets
    \item animations
    \item lazy loading
    \item sensors (mobile)
    \item web APIs (web)
    \item scripting and code integration where insufficient
    \item \todo{this should go to events} multi-touch support
    \item \todo{this should go to widgets} documents
    \item support for accessibility
    \item theming/dynamic styles?
    \item lifecycle support?
    \item uhhh, extra big (TVs)/extra small (smart watches) screens
    \item internationalization
\end{itemize}
