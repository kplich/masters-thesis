\subsection{Concepts missing}\label{subsec:concepts-missing}

as a reference, web, mobile and desktop technologies are used.

what seems to be missing are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item lotsa widgets
    \item animations
    \item \todo{can be done in a custom component?}lazy loading
    \item \todo{low-key czasem jest, bo sa jakies resource accessy?}internationalization
    \item
    \item global state (like a web store)

    \item support for accessibility
    \item scripting and code integration where insufficient
    \item lifecycle support?
    \item \todo{this should go to events} multi-touch support
    \item \todo{this should go to widgets} documents
    \item theming/dynamic styles?
\end{itemize}
