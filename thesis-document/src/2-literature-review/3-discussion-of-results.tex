\subsection{Discussion of results}\label{subsec:discussion-of-results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 paper with a review of UIDLs (though i'd say those are commercial implementation languages - so doesn't contain any new useful UIDLs, but discusses their expressiveness)
    \item 2 papers describing an approach for migrating interfaces exploiting an intermediate representation
    \item 4 papers describing 3 specific UI descriptions
    \item 6 papers describing 6 MBUID approaches
\end{itemize}

honorable mentions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item some papers seem to fit the description but are poorly described and the description is useless
    \item UIML has been mentioned multiple times but isn't concrete by itself
    \item MARIA and UsiXML seem to fit the bill but are also poorly described and unavailable
    \item IFML is for interaction specification
    \item some other modalities: voice, virtual reality (not sure if i should mention that), but not much info about that, difficult to combine with most graphical solutions
\end{itemize}
