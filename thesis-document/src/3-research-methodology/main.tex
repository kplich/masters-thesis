\section{Research methodology}\label{sec:research-methodology}

This section describes the methodology of research conducted in this thesis.
The goal of this research is to analyze papers selected in the previous section and answer RQ2 \textendash\ to what extent abstract representations of UI are expressive.
Results of the analysis and means to reach the goal are described in this section.
Section~\ref{subsec:evaluation-criteria} defines concepts that are necessary to create an accurate description of an application.
Section~\ref{subsec:evaluation-metrics-and-tools} translates them into concrete and measurable metrics that will be used to perform the evaluation.
Section~\ref{subsec:research-process} describes the evaluation process in detail.

As a result of the analysis, a few descriptions (MARIA~\cite{Paterno2009, MariaPDF}, Bouchelligua et al.~\cite{Bouchelligua2010}, Kry≈°tof~\cite{kryvstof2010lpgm}, Achilleos et al.~\cite{Achilleos2011}, and Miao et al.~\cite{Miao2017}) were excluded from the research.
The reason was a relative low quality (short descriptions lacking detail, unreadable diagrams, etc.).
The exclusion did not negatively influence the research methodology \textendash\ there was not an instance of a concept that only existed in one of the excluded papers.
