\subsection{Case studies}\label{subsec:case-studies}
This section defines criteria for a practical evaluation of the expressiveness of languages.
The evaluation will be carried out by attempting to recreate a certain existing UI in the languages.
Because of the lack of availability, the assessment will be carried out only for certain languages.

This section describes the test case against which the languages will be evaluated.
