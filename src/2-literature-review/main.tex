\section{Literature review}\label{sec:literature-review}

The methodology of this review has been based on guidelines published by Kitchenham and Charters~\cite{kitchenham_guidelines_2007}, and Neiva and L.~S.~Silva~\cite{neiva_systematic_2016}.
It will cover three phases, described in subsequent sections: preparation and planning (described in section~\ref{subsec:planning-and-preparation-for-review}), execution and reporting (described in section~\ref{subsec:conducting-and-reporting-the-search}), and discussion of results (section~\ref{subsec:review-discussion-of-results}).
