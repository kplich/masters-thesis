\chapter{Literature review}\label{ch:literature-review}

To identify research relevant to \textbf{RQ1: \enquote{what abstract UI representations exist?}}, a systematic literature review was conducted.
The methodology of this review has been based on guidelines published by Kitchenham and Charters~\cite{kitchenham_guidelines_2007} and Neiva and L.~S.~Silva~\cite{neiva_systematic_2016}.
It will cover three phases, described in subsequent sections: preparation and planning (described in section~\ref{sec:planning-and-preparation-for-review}), execution and reporting (described in section~\ref{sec:conducting-and-reporting-the-search}), and discussion of results (section~\ref{sec:review-discussion-of-results}).
