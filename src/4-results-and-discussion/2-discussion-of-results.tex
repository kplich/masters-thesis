%\subsubsection{Concepts missing}
%
%\todo[inline]{revise this section once you get the actual results; right now it feels too much like too early conclusions}
%
%Although the previous sections provide quite a comprehensive list of features, it is far from being complete.
%It might be possible to describe a wide range of application in these simplest terms, more features are necessary to make full-fledged development of applications using these languages more feasible.
%This section briefly describes the features that have not been found in any of the descriptions and which are to be found in various mobile, desktop and Web GUI technologies.
%
%\paragraph{Specialized widgets}
%As mentioned in the previous section, it is desirable for developers/modellers to work with a wide selection of components that neatly fit many possible use cases instead of developing them themselves.
%Unfortunately, they might find the current state of the descriptions lacking, with only the most basic variants of components available in the descriptions.
%For example, in some languages it is possible to use a grid layout;
%however, none of the languages seems to have a masonry layout\footnote{Masonry layout displays content in columns, but unlike a grid, it does not require the conent to be aligned in the row axis, which makes the arrangement more balanced.} defined.
%
%%\subparagraph{(Paged) documents}
%
%%\paragraph{Support for touch-screens}
%
%\paragraph{Dependency management}
%As the languages are not mature and widespread, there is little incentive to create, disseminate and manage reusable pieces of UI description.
%Therefore, there are not any mature mechanisms for managing any external dependencies or libraries comparable to what is available for conventional programming languages.
%
%\paragraph{Code integration}
%Currently, the languages presented are limited in their expressiveness by their limited set of actions that can be performed in response to events.
%While it might be a welcome simplification for people unfamiliar with programming, it poses a grave limitation for developers.
%It might be reasonable to accommodate for any gaps in the language by allowing to \enquote{patch} them with code instead.
%
%% \subparagraph{Component lifecycle support}
%% The languages could create a generic lifecycle and support it.
%
%\paragraph{Global application state}
%Most modern GUI programming enhances the event-driven paradigm with the principle of unidirectional data flow: events \enquote{flow} up (events from children components are handled by parent elements) and state \enquote{flows} down (parent components set the state of child components).
%While the principle helps make the components reusable, testable and simpler to a certain extent, it fails in the case where data needs to be available throughout the application.
%The response to this problem are \emph{state containers} that centralize the application state, making state management more predictable and flexible.
%Future iterations of UIDLs could integrate these solutions to increase the flexibility and maintainability of developed applications.
%
%\paragraph{Internationalization}
%% \todo{chyba ze to jest w ktoryms z jezykow? idk}
%Many production-grade applications require to be available in more than one language version.
%However, to generate multiple versions of an application`, each using a different language would be impractical;
%instead, any locale-dependent resources (primarily text) are stored outside application code and loaded during runtime, depending on the language set by the user/system.
%Integrating such a mechanism directly into the language would increase the value and flexibility of languages.
%% \todo[inline]{different text directions}
%
%% \paragraph{Accessibility} \todo{not really sure that's a single feature that can be easily included}
%
%\paragraph{Animations}
%While it is possible to create full-scale applications without any animations, they can still make a big difference and transform a satisfactory user experience to an outstanding one.
%Animations are useful for indicating navigation, interaction progress and state changes in a friendly and visually appealing way.
%Without this feature in UIDLs, generated applications might miss out on this subtle aspect of user experience.
%
%\paragraph{Design systems}
%Design systems have emerged as a solution easing the development of various applications across multiple teams by establishing clear and common rules and style guides, defining reusable patterns and components.
%By using them, organizations and companies can spend less time designing and implementing their applications, while achieving reliability and a unified appearance across all their products.
%So far, there seems to be no explicit support for defining any parts of a style guide in the UIDLs analyzed which make them less suitable for large-scale development.
%
%\paragraph{Dynamic appearance}
%% todo: 4 sure?
%Additionally, any support for making the appearance of some UI elements dependent on component/application state also seems to be largely absent.
%The most important application for such a feature would be implementation of application themes (especially the famous dark theme).
%This further prevents developers from implementing more engaging interactions and customizable experiences.
