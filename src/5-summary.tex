\chapter{Summary}\label{ch:summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item the goal of the thesis was to evaluate the expressiveness of abstract UI representations
    \item expressiveness was understood as ability to influence the final UI, as understood in Cameleon Ref Framework
    \item a literature review was conducted to find existing representations (after 2010 or sth)
    \item based on the review, representations were analyzed for implemented UI features
    \item they were grouped in four categories: architecture, behavior, components, appearance
    \item based on features, concrete criteria were formulated, as well as a practical case study
    \item representations were evaluated, a case study was implemented and the results were analyzed
    \item turns out, the representations are so-so expressive \textendash\ you can do some stuff, but not really everything
    \item in general the representations score ~30-40\% in criteria
    \item openuidl is the best (66\%) and is suitable for high-fidelity prototyping but not for full-scale programming yet \textendash\ the app looks promising
    \item the thesis is not a conclusive study, more can and should be conducted \textendash\ better criteria and more UIDLs
    \item future or existing UIDLs can use this and future work as reference for implementing new features
\end{itemize}
